# Vending Machine Application - CC_18_Ken_FRI12_GRP3_ASSIGNMENT2
<sub> SOFT2412 Assignment 2 - S2/2022 </sub>

### About

This vending machine application allows for users to select and checkout products, register and login, and allows for saved transactions and further functionalities given the user's access permissions such as report generation and managing products/cash/users.

### Running the Application

The application can be run with the command
```
gradle run
```
which will bring up the default window - the main products page. Users may register a new account for a more personalised access for future uses, or they may continue using anonymously. 

By default, there are no existing users and users will need to register.
There is a default owner user - this account may be accessed by:
```
Username: owner
Password: owner
```
which may be used to change user access for registered users later on and access owner functionalities. 

All functionalities for the user can be accessed through navigation of the menubar on the top left. 


### Testing

You may test the program with the command
```
gradle test
```
which will generate test reports under the reports folder. Testcase coverage is visible in the jacoco test reports accessible in this folder.
